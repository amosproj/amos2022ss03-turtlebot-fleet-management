## Product Vision 
The vision is to have a management system which helps fulfill daily tasks in a smart and intelligent way. TurtleBots are automated guided vehicles (AGVs) which assist humans without their intervention. The TurtleBot fleet management system is envisioned to bring intelligence to a fleet of these AGVs. It manages every robot to increase efficiency effectively.

## Project Mission
The mission is to develop three key components namely, a fleet management system, an on-robot navigation system and a user interface along with interfaces to have an intra-component communication. The fleet management system has to manage TurtleBots (AGVs) on a defined circular course. The TurtleBots need to communicate with the fleet management using MQTT & VDA5050 and should navigate in the available physical space to deliver small goods from a home station to a particular station on a pre-planned route and reorient themselves when going off-course. An interactive user interface should provide status information for every robot.
